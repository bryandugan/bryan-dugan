Below is a list of books I absolutely love and keep a copy of on my bookshelf at all times to go back and reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design-books\"><a href=\"#design-books\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Design Books</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://refactoringui.com/book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Refactoring UI</a> —  Adam Wathan &#x26; Steve Schoger</strong></p>\n<p>If you're only to have one book on UI design, this is it. This digital only book is an absolute must read if you're a developer that's interested in learning basic UI design principles, or if you're a designer that does any work creating user interfaces. If you're a developer, this book will make you rely less on a designer for creating good design decision. If you're a designer, this book will help you learn some elegant solutions to common UI problems and how to think a bit like a developer.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JJf55Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Don’t Make Me Think Revisited</a> — Scott Krug</strong></p>\n<p>An absolute essential for anyone that does any UX work. The revisited version is a must have, as it also goes over mobile UX. Most of the concepts are simple, but it's great to go over why you make unconscious design decisions. You'll also learn quite a few great new UX concepts through this book too!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Y7yx5E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Draplin Design Co. Pretty Much Everything</a> — Aaron James Draplin</strong></p>\n<p>After discovering Aaron Draplin and his work, I instantly felt connected to his work, and all of his wonderful stories. When the book was first announced, I just had to get my hands on his book. Thick lines with a great 70's vibe to everything he does. It's a great book to refer to for inspiration, or if you're looking for some fun design stories.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XNgNxc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, make people cry, and (every once in a while) change the world</a> — Michael Bierut</strong></p>\n<p>Michael Bierut is one of my all time favorite designers. With his bold Swiss design, everything he does is simple and clean, but with attention to detail. This book goes through a bit of his process, how he got started with design as well as a collection of his amazing work.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Y7ySVY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Logo</a> — Michael Evamy</strong></p>\n<p>An easy to use book to get inspiration for creating different logo types. The book is a collection of logos, organized by the style of the logo. Michael has got a few books out, but this one is my favorite as it's an overview on different logo types with a few examples. The other books are more in depth about certain styles.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PpczX2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Process in the Inspiration</a> — House Industries</strong></p>\n<p>House Industries is one of those companies that I have always admired from when I first got started with design. When I heard they were coming out with a book, I just had to get my hands on it! If you're into great design, typography and a bunch of great stories about how House Industries got started, this is the book for you. It's one of those great books to keep by your coffee table as a great conversation piece.</p>\n<h2 id=\"development-books\"><a href=\"#development-books\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Development Books</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XO0rnJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">JavaScript &#x26; jQuery</a>  — Jon Duckett</strong></p>\n<p>Even though the jQuery library is rarely used nowadays in web projects, it's a wonderful easy to read primer about the fundamentals of JavaScript. It's one of the most popular JavaScript reference books and with good reason.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2q2EnWI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CSS Secrets</a> — Lea Verou</strong></p>\n<p>A really fun book on building different CSS components. The book is dated, but it includes a lot of advanced CSS techniques to really make you stand out as a UI developer. It makes you think outside the box (pun intended) to solve complex UI problems.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Npa1FA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Eloquent JavaScript</a> — Marijn Haverbeke</strong></p>\n<p>A modern book that's regularly updated on everything you need to know to learn the essentials of JavaScript. If you prefer digital books, you can grab it on <a href=\"https://eloquentjavascript.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://eloquentjavascript.net/</a> for free.</p>\n<h2 id=\"books-to-better-yourself\"><a href=\"#books-to-better-yourself\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Books to Better Yourself</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/31QG7Q0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Business Side of Creativity</a> — Cameron S. Foote</strong></p>\n<p>If you're planning on getting into the world of freelance or are planning on starting a small creative business, read this book while getting started. It goes over EVERYTHING you need to start up a business. From setting up the business type, to how much to charge, how to expand, as well as examples of documents you should have on file. When Kelly and I started Spaceray Creative with the design/development chops, but not the business know-how, we kept this book by our side at all times.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SikJQg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Essentialism</a> — Greg McKeown</strong></p>\n<p>One of my all time favorite books, that I always go back to. In a distracted digital age, it's extremely easy to shift focus onto what you think is important without even realizing it. This book will help you prioritize tasks and keep yourself asking, is this the one thing I should be working on right now?</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xTOmy8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Miracle Morning</a> — Hal Elrod</strong></p>\n<p>The Miracle Morning isn't just a quick self help book, it's a lifestyle change! It involves waking up an hour earlier than you normally do to make time for yourself doing a set of tasks that help out every aspect of your life. If you're overwhelmed that you don't have any time to spend on yourself, or are waking up in the morning to answer to other people, than yourself; this book is for you. I've practiced this method off and on for the past few years and always feel better when I do the Mirarcle Morning routine.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/32uhwC9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to Win Friends &#x26; Influence People</a> — Dale Carnegie</strong></p>\n<p>If you're an introvert like me, sometimes you have a hard time discussing or selling things and it tires you out rather quickly. This book does a wonderful job at teaching you how to talk and connect with people. If you're doing any sort of sales, I highly recommend it!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That's it for now!
