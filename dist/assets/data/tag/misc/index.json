The plugin is perfect for quickly creating hero video backgrounds on a home page or landing pages on a website. It's also great for spotlight sections such as services or portfolio pages.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will focus on transcoding a video to the two main video formats on the web (mp4 and webm) and creating a video thumbnail to use while the video is loading or in case the browser doesn't support video.</p>\n<p>Throughout this tutorial, I will be working with a Craft field called <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">featuredVideo</code>, an asset field, with the asset type of video to pull the video.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-ffmpeg\"><a href=\"#installing-ffmpeg\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Installing ffmpeg</h2>\n<p>Transcoder utilizes the popular open-source FFmpeg library to directly do all of its transcodings on your development or server. If the server is a budget server or runs multiple web apps, I'd recommend placing a max upload size cap on the Craft field not to bog down the server. On my servers, I allow a max file size of 100MB, and if the video is larger, I link the client to my article \"<a href=\"https://bryandugan.com/using-handbrake-to-optimize-videos-for-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Using HandBrake to optimize videos for the web.</a>\"</p>\n<p><strong>Install FFmpeg locally</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #0F111A\"><code><span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">brew install ffmpeg</span></code></pre>\n<p><strong>Install brew on Ubuntu server</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #0F111A\"><code><span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">sudo apt-get update</span>\n<span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">sudo apt-get install ffmpeg</span></code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"configuring-transcoder\"><a href=\"#configuring-transcoder\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Configuring Transcoder</h2>\n<p>For Transcoder to work, you will need to copy the <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">config.php</code> file that is located in <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">vendor &gt; nystudio107 &gt; craft-transcoder &gt; src</code> and paste it to the <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">craft/config</code> folder as <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">transcoder.php</code></p>\n<p><strong>Now we need to get the path for FFmpeg on the device that will be running Transcoder.

One of the many ways I do that, is I collect and listen to vinyl records.</p>\n<p>Recently, I inherited my parent's old vinyl collection which has been sitting in a basement untouched for around 30 years. A lot of them had a thick layer of dust on them since many weren't in sleeves and were left in the open. The collection needed a lot of love to get them restored to their old glory. When posting about the progress on Social Media, I've had a few people ask for pointers and tips. I thought it would be a great idea to write about that process and document for other people restoring their old collections.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 2560 1920' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-6bd3c7c91256bb8a823f316068ec42d3'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-6bd3c7c91256bb8a823f316068ec42d3)' width='2560' height='1920' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAwAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcDBAUIAf/EAC8QAAICAQMDAwIFBAMAAAAAAAECAwQRAAUhBhIxE0FhIlEHFHGR4YGxwdEjcqH/xAAYAQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBAUDAf/EACURAAEDBAEDBQEAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMEESExEiJhgRNCcbHwkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ANug9xaPa1hY8xsQB8HnRvXvsy40m9p3B6xzG2M%2beMjTD2KSzb252DBLGMpkcfodQp6BrKguBw4q7DM2WIcm5AVfenMe6yccMA2oPzAA51Wt2pHsN64YzL9LBhyMe2smzvFVZOx5ol%2bO8arUro7dCTqg/3LfSwrDzqhvfU2zbA1cbzdSqZwTH3KxyB58A6ihv1kRGaRB3kBec5J8aVn4yS1b/AFHWis23iWrTz2qhfJYsQSBjHtqi8Hio4I5JnwdcdLTEMN9oqp8F3Kf3A0b9MWKe5QrZ2%2bzBagJKiSFw65HkZGuMgirZWNQJR6K5LIo%2brHPPuNdafgPtwpfh1s47e0zI9gj/ALuSP/MaiV8QjZyvtUKeYvJbbSUdmxJGrQxKTJ4J%2b2pKHXG/0e6s1K7N2jCNGygEfJPI0KdcxyUGabbJJocZ7lWVsE%2bQfP66Bh1TvCKGW5YwfGJm/wB6ZjhkDuYt5COSeIt9M3HwdroDpN5rg3Sxu9iKrasQkKZJSqqSfGT%2bg0K7m%2b8wTvBX2mrLGTj1IrsTA/OSeP20oJep9w3R46t%2bWSeJnA7ZHLAH74OtZdrq%2bksknYkZdVJ7RwCPP74Gt6Wm2XZJ/n0saqt1wwAPP2nn0btkcKLY3V6UU4cPGn5pWKYH3B%2bToR/EaWhFv1iL0RYZ4h/yIwYYbn%2bvgcZ0p7jrTvrWNWJlJP1YweP41BX6hcYVa6qPh/40xIQ7AFj%2b7JNl9uyP3dGBqHeHhrUa1anOqNl0yivnGF8nkc66y6Mt1a3T1CCuw7IIEhwfIKqBz%2b2uNtu3%2b9FfjjgBjmLAZz4%2beR9tNDZ%2bv02bZYLtmxYmWc%2bi8nepAfu5wuOMD3541Or4XvADimKd7Wg8Ah/qK9WuUYJ1lXsmQMPc/ccaX01IRU5Q1OQkuSk/dhcfbW5LRaBAiRlY1GFAHga9lsRtsljb7SP9YLRMBnDfPwdVQOTjfCVcS0C2UJxbXPBLHPMvYgcMCcc85xn9NENiRxtssbRsoI7DIxAUfbGqVmzaO3io%2bJ4lGF%2bkqfjODz/XV3cbBt7VcrFSTJ2FePdSv%2bj%2b%2buMwChfckXCzLpNtg5KeqqElhICM9vbrOo0hHciazhq4Yd/puue3PONe06c8DyH0O4nAAYcHn%2bNSHb5cQhoh2kEOYwSwGff/ABrPfWdrTXSFoTSxQLZtQjtTHpQgsGIz9yPfGs%2bjP6sbU5nIglbuGfCP4Df41bl2%2bRdqhiVSO0d7ceWPnVWlByXYcL/fQSAvICNhDBdf/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e\" width=\"2560\" alt=\"Bryan Dugan Vinyl Collection\" data-srcset=\"/assets/static/bryan-dugan-vinyl-collection.82a2fbd.b7d1ef90e592bcd690da32318f7e38b3.jpg 480w, /assets/static/bryan-dugan-vinyl-collection.cbab2cf.b7d1ef90e592bcd690da32318f7e38b3.jpg 1024w, /assets/static/bryan-dugan-vinyl-collection.2665e34.b7d1ef90e592bcd690da32318f7e38b3.jpg 1920w, /assets/static/bryan-dugan-vinyl-collection.42db587.b7d1ef90e592bcd690da32318f7e38b3.jpg 2560w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" data-src=\"/assets/static/bryan-dugan-vinyl-collection.42db587.b7d1ef90e592bcd690da32318f7e38b3.jpg\"><noscript><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded\" src=\"/assets/static/bryan-dugan-vinyl-collection.42db587.b7d1ef90e592bcd690da32318f7e38b3.jpg\" width=\"2560\" alt=\"Bryan Dugan Vinyl Collection\"></noscript></p>\n<h2 id=\"cleaning-album-coverssleeves\"><a href=\"#cleaning-album-coverssleeves\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Cleaning Album Covers/Sleeves</h2>\n<p>I start by taking aÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZG0dig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">swifter duster</a>Â and dusting the heavy dirt/dust off each cover.</p>\n<p>I then use a very slightly damp microfiber cloth with a few sprays ofÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zBF8uG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mrs. Meyers multi-surface cleaner</a>Â to wipe each album cover. I wanted to use something with no harsh chemicals. A simple cleaner to get some of the dust/mildew smell off of them. Once the cloth gets a bit dirty, swap it out for a fresh one. Also, be extremely careful not to scrub hard or make the cloth too wet, or else you risk taking the ink off the cover.</p>\n<p>If a cover's bottom is completely worn down, I take some masking tape and place it on the bottom to close it back up. If you care about the color of the tape, Scotch has an \"expressions\" line with multiple colors to try and match with the album art. I keep aÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36EM7iQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">black tape</a>Â and a defaultÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2X1OvNk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">beige</a>Â on hand.</p>\n<p>Once each cover is done, it's time to take a look at all the sleeves. If the vinyl is missing a sleeve, or just has a plain sleeve, I instantly replace it with aÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31SkpLl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Big Fudge brand sleeve</a>. These sleeves work great and arenât too expensive.</p>\n<p>If the album has a custom sleeve, I wipe the sleeve, and keep the original sleeve in the case and place the record into a new sleeve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cleaning-vinyl---organized-by-how-dirtyscratched-each-one-is\"><a href=\"#cleaning-vinyl---organized-by-how-dirtyscratched-each-one-is\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Cleaning vinyl - organized by how dirty/scratched each one is</h2>\n<p>There are different options for cleaning the vinyl, depending on how dirty or scratched it is. I have tried to cover the top three use cases. Deep gouges, medium scratches, and small scratches.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cleaning a scratched record won't get the scratches out, but it might help album playback and fix small skips.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"for-cracks-deep-gouges-and-a-lot-of-deep-scratches\"><a href=\"#for-cracks-deep-gouges-and-a-lot-of-deep-scratches\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>For cracks, deep gouges and a lot of deep scratches</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, there isn't too much to do in this situation, a few of the records I got were just in too rough of shape and I ended up recycling these. It's not only near impossible to repair these. It's also likely you may also damage your player's needle or reduce its life dramatically if you attempt to play these. If you feel bad about letting these albums go, you can use these beat-up LP's to createÂ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4EoCt5KVck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">coasters</a>Â and otherÂ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OifXWdkqc0Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">neat things</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-medium-sized-scratches-andor-heavy-dirt\"><a href=\"#for-medium-sized-scratches-andor-heavy-dirt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>For medium-sized scratches and/or heavy dirt</h3>\n<p>If your album has some playback issues such as the occasional skip, you can give the following process a try for cleaner playback.</p>\n<p>Start this process by cleaning the album regularly to get all the heavy dirt/grime off it. I use a generic distilled water spray, along with a microfiber cloth to clean the albums.</p>\n<p>After cleaning the record, you can cover the record with a thin layer of wood glue. You heard that right, wood glue. Believe it or not, Wood Glue makes the perfect album cleaner. UseÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3d6PFNd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Titebond 2 wood glue</a>Â and spread it over evenly using some spare card stock (avoid the label or use something to cover the label completely so it doesn't get damaged) and let it dry for a day or two. Once the glue is dried, peel off the glue. It should all be able to come off in one piece. Then, clean the album again with a distilled water based spray to get the last of the glue off, and it's good to go. This process is time-consuming, but well worth it if you get a few skips or if the album loops in places.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>Â I'd recommend picking up the wood glue at your local hardware store since I've noticed it to be a bit expensive online.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-small-sized-scratches-and-dust\"><a href=\"#for-small-sized-scratches-and-dust\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>For small-sized scratches and dust</h3>\n<p>A lot of the pieces of vinyl I was working with were caked in a thick layer of dust and needed a heavy cleaning. For the dust, I used distilled water, along with a microfiber cloth to get all the heavy stuff off of each record. I then usedÂ <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RRM3QWS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1&#x26;fbclid=IwAR0eHbedaiysvirDQvCC68b4hG_-V1SsvXDCn2vR2MBSSFoMsrC0wTEAh9Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Boundless Cleaning Solution solvent</a>Â to clean over them once again. Wait for the vinyl to dry completely before attempting to play it again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"general-cleaning-before-each-play\"><a href=\"#general-cleaning-before-each-play\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>General cleaning before each play</h3>\n<p>It's important to clean both the stylus and do a quick once over of the vinyl before each play to remove any excess dust, especially if youâre playing an older album. Before playing any record in my collection, I give it a quick once over with theÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2X2dRe2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vinyl Buddy record cleaner</a>. It does a wonderful job of picking up debris. However, after every few cleans, run it under water and scrub off any excess dirt with your hands. Then leave it in its case with the lid half-opened for it to dry. Make sure to clean the record cleaner about once a week with normal use, or you risk scratching your record.</p>\n<p>For the stylus itself, I give it a quick brush with aÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ekID7G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">stylus cleaner brush</a>. When you play a record that hasn't been played in a long time, be sure to clean the stylus after. Even after playing a cleaned record, dust and debris will still be heavy in the Vinyl's grooves for the first few playbacks. So make sure to clean that stylus after each play-through. To clean the stylus, clean from the back, moving forwards. Otherwise, you could risk damaging the stylus. Here is aÂ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvaz07Majog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">quick video</a>Â that shows how to do it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even after playing a cleaned record, dust and debris will still be heavy in the vinyl's grooves for the first few playbacks.

If there's one good thing that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon us (if you always wanted to work remote), is that it forced everyone, small agencies, to the corporate environment to test their entire staff to work from home.</p>\n<p>For many people, this is a first time experience as many employees are used to working from an office. I've been a mostly remote employee for the last four years and below is a shortlist of things I have learned over the years while working from home that you can apply to your work from home lifestyle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-designated-room-for-work\"><a href=\"#have-a-designated-room-for-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Have a designated room for work</h2>\n<p>This is one of the single most important things about starting to work from home. You need some sort of space that is designated for work only. Starting, working at your kitchen table or bedroom for a week or two might be fine. But it is by no means a long term solution</p>\n<p>Avoid working from your bedroom at all costs. The room you work in will start being associated with work and you will find it hard to unwind at the end of the day. Here's a solution that worked for me when I first started working remotely before I had the spare bedroom. I had separated the bedroom space in half using a curtain hung up on a PVC pipe and had the room divided with anÂ <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-black-brown-10275862/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IKEA Kallax</a>Â shelving unit. This way, while working, the bed and living area was never in plain sight. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>You don't always have to work from the office but try to keep most of your work there. Sometimes I like to work from the couch in the living room with the TV off or outside on the balcony if it's a nice day. But even for things like the couch, I bought a separate couch for the office for when I want to work in a more relaxed pose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-dressed-and-follow-a-daily-routine\"><a href=\"#get-dressed-and-follow-a-daily-routine\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Get dressed and follow a daily routine</h2>\n<p>While working from home, one of the running jokes is that you can sit and work in your pajamas all day. I'll admit, this is fun for the first few days of working remote, however, like working from a kitchen table, it makes the days all sort of blend together. Instead, I have created a morning routine and take an hour for myself before I get to work.</p>\n<p>Every morning before work, I'll wake up and attempt theÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gjHxuE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Miracle Morning</a>, shower, get dressed, and make a cup of coffee before walking to the office. Getting ready in the morning, makes me feel much better overall and ready to take on the workday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-crutch-word-to-let-people-youre-about-to-talk-in-a-meeting\"><a href=\"#have-a-crutch-word-to-let-people-youre-about-to-talk-in-a-meeting\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Have a crutch word to let people you're about to talk in a meeting</h2>\n<p>Sometimes being the only person dialing in to a call with 10 employees that are in office, it can be tough to speak up and speak your mind. People tend to rely on some sort of visual cue to let others know you're about to talk. When working remotely, the visual cues that you're about to speak just don't exist. Even if you have your camera up, people likely aren't paying attention to it. Before I'm about to speak, I always use the word \"so\" to get everyone's attention. That filler word at the beginning of a sentence gives the rest of the room a brief moment to get their attention to the speakers and also help some latency issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-your-camera-in-meetings\"><a href=\"#use-your-camera-in-meetings\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Use your camera in meetings</h2>\n<p>During any meeting with co-workers, I'll always keep my camera up and going if it's a smaller meeting. If the meeting has more than 10 people in it, I will generally keep it off as it can become distracting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-cool-off-period-after-work\"><a href=\"#have-a-cool-off-period-after-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Have a cool off period after work</h2>\n<p>As silly as it may sound, I save the last 10-15 minutes of my day for the \"commute\" home to wind down and relax after work. Before leaving my office for the day, I like to spend 10-15 minutes browsing news sites, listen to a podcast, or do whatever it is that helps me unwind after work. It helps to transition the brain from work to relax mode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-frequent-breaks\"><a href=\"#take-frequent-breaks\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Take frequent breaks</h2>\n<p>After every hour or two, I like to get up and walk around for 15 minutes and do something that isn't in front of the screen to clear my mind and refocus. I might go and do some pushups, use a medicine ball, or do some stretches using aÂ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2B4QV5k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">foam roller</a>. It's also ok to take 15 minutes to do a load of dishes or start a load of laundry. Just don't make it the time to clean your entire house.</p>\n<p>Don't feel bad about taking these short breaks. If you think about it, the time spent doing water cooler chat, or the normal day office distractions is likely longer than your breaks at home. If you're an in-office employee, also be sure to get up and stretch or go for a short walk every hour or two. Your body and mind will thank you for it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"talk-with-your-significant-otherkids\"><a href=\"#talk-with-your-significant-otherkids\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Talk with your significant other/kids</h2>\n<p>When many people start working from home, others start to see you as just being home, instead of working. They don't realize that them coming in and asking questions in the middle of the day can be a real distraction. Instead of just putting up with it, have a sit-down, and talk with the other people in your household. Politely let them know that when you're in the office, not to be bothered and set some sort of guidelines. Let them know if it's something non-urgent to send you a text message or to send you an Email then let them in when you're ready for a break.</p>\n<h2 id=\"let-others-in-your-household-know-when-youre-in-meetings\"><a href=\"#let-others-in-your-household-know-when-youre-in-meetings\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Let others in your household know when you're in meetings</h2>\n<p>It's ok to have a few distractions throughout the day from loved ones but be sure to alert them when you're in deep work mode and cannot be distracted.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few ways you can alert others that you cannot be bothered. I've heard things as clever as having a Phillips hue bulb sync with a calendar to turn on and change color to red when in a meeting. But for me, It's simple and effective enough to put a note on the door when I need to focus or am getting ready to jump on a call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"schedule-regular-sync-up-calls-and-status-updates-with-your-colleagues\"><a href=\"#schedule-regular-sync-up-calls-and-status-updates-with-your-colleagues\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Schedule regular sync-up calls and status updates with your colleagues</h2>\n<p>Twice a week (Monday and Wednesday), my team of four and I would meet up virtually after lunch to talk about what our main goals for the week were. If your group is larger than 4-5 people, it may be a good idea to break it up into separate groups with similar goals then have the manager be in both calls. It helps keep everyone engaged with talking to each other. Also, feel free to create a water-cooler chat in Slack or MSTeams to talk about non-work related things.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"The ability to work from home is a trained skill that takes time to master just like anything else.

We have come to need websites that are as flexible as we are. How many times were you on the go, when someone has told you about a new product or service? You then pull out your phone to see what it's all about. The business/product's website you go to isn't responsive, and you have a horrible time getting around the site, pinching, and zooming to try, and read the text. If you are anything like me, I start to get tired of trying to find the information I'm looking for if it's not easily accessible and just abandon looking up more on the product (even if the product itself is great). This is why it's extremely important to have a website that works on any device that the user may be trying to access it from.</p>\n<p>According to officialÂ <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/its-official-google-says-more-searches-now-on-mobile-than-on-desktop-220369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google statements</a>Â from 2019, more thanÂ <strong>50%</strong>Â of search queries globally now come from mobile devices.</p>\n<p>An article fromÂ <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/mobile-internet-use-passes-desktop-for-the-first-time-study-finds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">TechCrunch</a>Â back inÂ <strong>2016</strong>, stated that it was the first year that mobile web users have surpassed desktop users, which no longer made marketing websites on desktop only an optional choice.</p>\n<p>Thereâs even a good chance youâre reading this article on a mobile device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-have-a-responsive-website\"><a href=\"#why-have-a-responsive-website\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Why have a responsive website?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-website-usage-increasing\"><a href=\"#mobile-website-usage-increasing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>Mobile website usage increasing</strong></h3>\n<p>The more general marketing websites I work on, the more I'm starting to see a trend, with at least aÂ <strong>50% tablet/mobile market</strong>Â toÂ <strong>50% desktop/laptop</strong>Â market. At the very least, you should have your website work well on Desktop and Mobile. There are plenty of users that browse on a tablet, but that number is usually a bit lower compared to desktop/mobile users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"better-for-user-experience-ux\"><a href=\"#better-for-user-experience-ux\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Better for User Experience (UX)</h3>\n<p>Keeping a consistent look and feel that's similar on type of device is better for brand recognition and how that user interacts with the website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-cost-effective\"><a href=\"#more-cost-effective\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>More cost-effective</strong></h3>\n<p>Building a fully responsive website does add extra hours to a web development project, but that extra up-front cost is worth it in the long run.</p>\n<p>In my personal experience, the clients that say they don't care about responsive websites will soon regret that decision. Taking a site that isn't responsive at all, and trying to convert it over to a responsive website would be like asking for an apple pie, but then deciding you wanted blueberry instead. The crust is still there, but it would be much easier, just to make a new blueberry pie from scratch than fixing what's already there. Same goes with web development, the developer would be usually better off just re-building the website from scratch if a mobile experience wasn't in the original scope of work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"google-recommends-it-for-seo-search-engine-optimization\"><a href=\"#google-recommends-it-for-seo-search-engine-optimization\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>Google recommends it for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</strong></h3>\n<p>When Google Bots take a look at your website, there are multiple things that the search engine looks for. A new thing that it had started doing over the past few years is taking a look to see if it is optimized for the device the user is trying to view it on.</p>\n<p>Say I have a regular non-responsive site that is all about toothpaste. When I go on a desktop, and type Hockey into Google, my page appears to be ranked first. But if I was to go to do that same search for toothpaste on a phone, my page about toothpaste may appear further down the page. With over half the searches coming from mobile nowadays, I'd be losing out on a good chunk of visibility/revenue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"keep-up-with-the-competition\"><a href=\"#keep-up-with-the-competition\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>Keep up with the competition</strong></h3>\n<p>A mobile user is a lot more likely to stay at a website that is mobile-friendly. If your competitor's sites have a better web experience on a competitor's site, they are much more willing to go with that competitor's product.</p>\n<p>There are a few exceptions to needing a mobile responsive website though. One example would be Internal Enterprise websites where the user is on a desktop/laptop for their day job. In cases like this though, the budget that would normally go towards responsive features would go toward better compatibility with legacy browsers. Another example of something that doesn't need to be responsive is a Kiosk or presentation application where the web-app is meant to only be viewed on one particular device.</p>\n<p>If your website is a general marketing site, opt for a responsive website, or go with an agency that uses responsive websites by default.
