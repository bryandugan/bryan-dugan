Moving from Bitbucket to GitHub is a bit of a time-consuming task. But once you get the first repository transferred, the process should become quicker each time you do it. It took me about a day to get all my repositories transferred, so if you're looking for a great rainy day project, this would be it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\"><a href=\"#getting-started\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Getting started</h2>\n<p>Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. Make sure to <strong>NOT</strong> check \"Initialize this repository with a README\". If you have accidentally created a repository with a README file, you'll have to delete the repository and create it again.</p>\n<p>Now that we have our Github repository set up, make sure your local version of your Bitbucket repository is completely up to date.</p>\n<p>In your local bitbucket repository add the new GitHub URL by creating a new remote. In this example, let's name it upstream.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> project-directory\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> remote <span class=\"token function\">add</span> upstream https://github.com/<span class=\"token environment constant\">USER</span>/PROJECT.git</code></pre>\n<p>Now, push all your branches and tags to the newly created GitHub Repository.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> push upstream master\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> push upstream BRANCH-NAME\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> push --tags upstream</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"quick-troubleshooting\"><a href=\"#quick-troubleshooting\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Quick troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>Here are a few small issues that I came across while doing my first migration and how to solve them.</p>\n<p><strong>Accidentally entered the wrong URL</strong></p>\n<p>If you set the URL wrong while adding the repo, you can run the following command to reset it:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> remote set-url upstream https://github.com/<span class=\"token environment constant\">USER</span>/PROJECT.git</code></pre>\n<p><strong>\"Invalid username or password\" error</strong></p>\n<p>You'll need to generate a personal access token on the GitHub website at <code>settings > developer settings > personal access tokens</code> from there you can generate a new token. That token is only displayed once so make sure to copy it and save it somewhere like your password manager. When asked for your password in the terminal, use your GitHub password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clean-up-the-old-repository\"><a href=\"#clean-up-the-old-repository\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Clean up the old repository</h2>\n<p>Now that your repository is successfully migrated over to Github, don't forget to remove the old repository from Bitbucket.</p>\n<p>In Bitbucket, open your repository, and go to <code>Settings > Delete repository</code> and delete the repository.</p>\n<p>While deleting the Bitbucket repository, Bitbucket will ask you if you would like to set up a redirect. If you work with other developers on the project, it's highly recommended that you set up the redirect over to the new GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remove-old-bitbucket-origin-and-set-it-to-github\"><a href=\"#remove-old-bitbucket-origin-and-set-it-to-github\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Remove old Bitbucket origin and set it to GitHub</h2>\n<p>Once the repository is successfully transferred over to Github, you'll need to change your remote origin URL to be able to make new commits in your repository.</p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sourcetree</a> to manage all my repositories.
