I use it, because it's easy to setup and doesn't require running a Vagrant box or anything else too complicated. It turns your Mac into a development server by running Nginx in the background as you start your computer. My personal favorite feature, is that you can run <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">valet park</code> in your local development directory, and any folder in that directory becomes a <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">.test</code> domain. So if you have a folder called <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">my-website</code>, open your favorite browser and type in <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">my-website.test</code> and you'll be directed to your index file in the <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">my-website</code> folder.</p>\n<p>To set up Valet, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jalendport/running-craft-cms-3-on-laravel-valet-6df61e5193fd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jalen Davenport's absolutely wonderful guide</a> on how to set up Valet. It's geared towards Craft CMS development, but the basic install is all the same for whatever type of web development you'll be doing.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"This is the Homebrew Cask setup of my personal development laptop.
