This digital-only book is an absolute must-read if you're a developer that's interested in learning basic UI design principles, or if you're a designer that does any work creating user interfaces. If you're a developer, this book will help you to rely less on a designer for making good design decisions.

Pretty Much Everything</h3>\n<p>After discovering Aaron Draplin and his work, I instantly felt connected to his work, and all of his wonderful stories. When the book was first announced, I just had to get my hands on his book. Thick lines with a great 70's vibe to everything he does. It's a great book to refer to for inspiration, or if you're looking for some fun design stories.</p>\n<p>Aaron James Draplin — <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cZsaWl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hardcover</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-graphic-design-to-sell-things-explain-things-make-things-look-better-make-people-laugh-make-people-cry-and-every-once-in-a-while-change-the-world\"><a href=\"#how-to-use-graphic-design-to-sell-things-explain-things-make-things-look-better-make-people-laugh-make-people-cry-and-every-once-in-a-while-change-the-world\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, make people cry, and (every once in a while) change the world</h3>\n<p>Michael Bierut is one of my all-time favorite designers.

The book is a collection of logos, organized by the style of the logo. Michael has got a few books out, but this one is my favorite as it's an overview of different logotypes with a few examples. The other books are more in-depth about certain styles.</p>\n<p>Michael Evamy — <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3c1Dqjq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Paperback</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-process-is-the-inspiration\"><a href=\"#the-process-is-the-inspiration\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Process is the Inspiration</h3>\n<p>House Industries is one of those companies that I have always admired when I first got started with design.
