Moving from Bitbucket to GitHub is a bit of a time-consuming task. But once you get the first repository transferred, the process should become quicker each time you do it. It took me about a day to get all my repositories transferred, so if you're looking for a great rainy day project, this would be it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\"><a href=\"#getting-started\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Getting started</h2>\n<p>Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. Make sure to <strong>NOT</strong> check \"Initialize this repository with a README\".

In this example, let's name it upstream.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #0F111A\"><code><span style=\"color: #82AAFF\">cd</span><span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\"> project-directory</span>\n<span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">git remote add upstream https://github.com/USER/PROJECT.git</span></code></pre>\n<p>Now, push all your branches and tags to the newly created GitHub Repository.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #0F111A\"><code><span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">git push upstream master</span>\n<span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">git push upstream BRANCH-NAME</span>\n<span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">git push --tags upstream</span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"quick-troubleshooting\"><a href=\"#quick-troubleshooting\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Quick troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>Here are a few small issues that I came across while doing my first migration and how to solve them.</p>\n<p><strong>Accidentally entered the wrong URL</strong></p>\n<p>If you set the URL wrong while adding the repo, you can run the following command to reset it:</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #0F111A\"><code><span style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/USER/PROJECT.git</span></code></pre>\n<p><strong>\"Invalid username or password\" error</strong></p>\n<p>You'll need to generate a personal access token on the GitHub website at <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">settings &gt; developer settings &gt; personal access tokens</code> from there you can generate a new token. That token is only displayed once so make sure to copy it and save it somewhere like your password manager.

This digital-only book is an absolute must-read if you're a developer that's interested in learning basic UI design principles, or if you're a designer that does any work creating user interfaces. If you're a developer, this book will help you to rely less on a designer for making good design decisions. If you're a designer, this book will help you learn some elegant solutions to common UI problems and how to think a bit like a developer.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gi39ri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Don’t Make Me Think Revisited</a> — Scott Krug</strong></p>\n<p>An essential read for anyone that is getting started in UX. The revisited version is a must-have, as it also goes over mobile UX. Most of the concepts are simple, but it's great to go over why you make unconscious design decisions. You'll also learn quite a few great new UX concepts through this book!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cZsaWl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Draplin Design Co. Pretty Much Everything</a> — Aaron James Draplin</strong></p>\n<p>After discovering Aaron Draplin and his work, I instantly felt connected to his work, and all of his wonderful stories. When the book was first announced, I just had to get my hands on his book. Thick lines with a great 70's vibe to everything he does. It's a great book to refer to for inspiration, or if you're looking for some fun design stories.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zpA0ty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, make people cry, and (every once in a while) change the world</a> — Michael Bierut</strong></p>\n<p>Michael Bierut is one of my all-time favorite designers. With his bold Swiss design, everything he does is simple and clean, but with attention to detail. This book goes through a bit of his process, how he got started with design as well as a collection of his amazing work.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3c1Dqjq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Logo</a> — Michael Evamy</strong></p>\n<p>An easy to use book to get inspiration for creating different logotypes. The book is a collection of logos, organized by the style of the logo. Michael has got a few books out, but this one is my favorite as it's an overview of different logotypes with a few examples. The other books are more in-depth about certain styles.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LY4x4x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Process in the Inspiration</a> — House Industries</strong></p>\n<p>House Industries is one of those companies that I have always admired when I first got started with design. When I heard they were coming out with a book, I just had to get my hands on it!

Foote</strong></p>\n<p>If you're planning on getting into the world of freelance or are planning on starting a small creative business, get this book now. The Business side to Creativity goes over EVERYTHING you need to start up a business. From setting up the business type, how much to charge, how to expand, and examples of documents you should have on file. When Kelly and I started Spaceray Creative with the design/development chops, but not the business know-how, we kept this book by our side at all times.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XpHu87\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Essentialism</a> — Greg McKeown</strong></p>\n<p>One of my all-time favorite books, that I always go back to. In a distracted digital age, it's extremely easy to shift focus onto what you think is important without even realizing it. This book will help you prioritize tasks and keep yourself asking, is this the one thing I should be working on right now?</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XpT9nf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Miracle Morning</a> — Hal Elrod</strong></p>\n<p>The Miracle Morning isn't just a quick self-help book, it's an entire lifestyle change. It involves waking up an hour earlier than you normally do to make time for yourself doing a set of tasks that help out every aspect of your life. If you're overwhelmed that you don't have any time to spend on yourself or are waking up in the morning to answer to other people, other than yourself; this book is for you. I've practiced this method off and on for the past few years and always feel better when I do the Miracle Morning routine.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M1qBLn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to Win Friends &#x26; Influence People</a> — Dale Carnegie</strong></p>\n<p>If you're an introvert like me, sometimes you have a hard time discussing or selling things and it tires you out rather quickly.

If there's one good thing that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon us (if you always wanted to work remote), is that it forced everyone, small agencies, to the corporate environment to test their entire staff to work from home.</p>\n<p>For many people, this is a first time experience as many employees are used to working from an office. I've been a mostly remote employee for the last four years and below is a shortlist of things I have learned over the years while working from home that you can apply to your work from home lifestyle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-designated-room-for-work\"><a href=\"#have-a-designated-room-for-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Have a designated room for work</h2>\n<p>This is one of the single most important things about starting to work from home. You need some sort of space that is designated for work only. Starting, working at your kitchen table or bedroom for a week or two might be fine. But it is by no means a long term solution</p>\n<p>Avoid working from your bedroom at all costs. The room you work in will start being associated with work and you will find it hard to unwind at the end of the day. Here's a solution that worked for me when I first started working remotely before I had the spare bedroom. I had separated the bedroom space in half using a curtain hung up on a PVC pipe and had the room divided with an <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-black-brown-10275862/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IKEA Kallax</a> shelving unit. This way, while working, the bed and living area was never in plain sight. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>You don't always have to work from the office but try to keep most of your work there. Sometimes I like to work from the couch in the living room with the TV off or outside on the balcony if it's a nice day. But even for things like the couch, I bought a separate couch for the office for when I want to work in a more relaxed pose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-dressed-and-follow-a-daily-routine\"><a href=\"#get-dressed-and-follow-a-daily-routine\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Get dressed and follow a daily routine</h2>\n<p>While working from home, one of the running jokes is that you can sit and work in your pajamas all day. I'll admit, this is fun for the first few days of working remote, however, like working from a kitchen table, it makes the days all sort of blend together. Instead, I have created a morning routine and take an hour for myself before I get to work.</p>\n<p>Every morning before work, I'll wake up and attempt the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gjHxuE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Miracle Morning</a>, shower, get dressed, and make a cup of coffee before walking to the office. Getting ready in the morning, makes me feel much better overall and ready to take on the workday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-crutch-word-to-let-people-youre-about-to-talk-in-a-meeting\"><a href=\"#have-a-crutch-word-to-let-people-youre-about-to-talk-in-a-meeting\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Have a crutch word to let people you're about to talk in a meeting</h2>\n<p>Sometimes being the only person dialing in to a call with 10 employees that are in office, it can be tough to speak up and speak your mind. People tend to rely on some sort of visual cue to let others know you're about to talk. When working remotely, the visual cues that you're about to speak just don't exist. Even if you have your camera up, people likely aren't paying attention to it. Before I'm about to speak, I always use the word \"so\" to get everyone's attention. That filler word at the beginning of a sentence gives the rest of the room a brief moment to get their attention to the speakers and also help some latency issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-your-camera-in-meetings\"><a href=\"#use-your-camera-in-meetings\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Use your camera in meetings</h2>\n<p>During any meeting with co-workers, I'll always keep my camera up and going if it's a smaller meeting. If the meeting has more than 10 people in it, I will generally keep it off as it can become distracting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-cool-off-period-after-work\"><a href=\"#have-a-cool-off-period-after-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Have a cool off period after work</h2>\n<p>As silly as it may sound, I save the last 10-15 minutes of my day for the \"commute\" home to wind down and relax after work. Before leaving my office for the day, I like to spend 10-15 minutes browsing news sites, listen to a podcast, or do whatever it is that helps me unwind after work. It helps to transition the brain from work to relax mode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-frequent-breaks\"><a href=\"#take-frequent-breaks\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Take frequent breaks</h2>\n<p>After every hour or two, I like to get up and walk around for 15 minutes and do something that isn't in front of the screen to clear my mind and refocus. I might go and do some pushups, use a medicine ball, or do some stretches using a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2B4QV5k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">foam roller</a>. It's also ok to take 15 minutes to do a load of dishes or start a load of laundry. Just don't make it the time to clean your entire house.</p>\n<p>Don't feel bad about taking these short breaks. If you think about it, the time spent doing water cooler chat, or the normal day office distractions is likely longer than your breaks at home. If you're an in-office employee, also be sure to get up and stretch or go for a short walk every hour or two. Your body and mind will thank you for it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"talk-with-your-significant-otherkids\"><a href=\"#talk-with-your-significant-otherkids\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Talk with your significant other/kids</h2>\n<p>When many people start working from home, others start to see you as just being home, instead of working. They don't realize that them coming in and asking questions in the middle of the day can be a real distraction. Instead of just putting up with it, have a sit-down, and talk with the other people in your household. Politely let them know that when you're in the office, not to be bothered and set some sort of guidelines. Let them know if it's something non-urgent to send you a text message or to send you an Email then let them in when you're ready for a break.</p>\n<h2 id=\"let-others-in-your-household-know-when-youre-in-meetings\"><a href=\"#let-others-in-your-household-know-when-youre-in-meetings\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Let others in your household know when you're in meetings</h2>\n<p>It's ok to have a few distractions throughout the day from loved ones but be sure to alert them when you're in deep work mode and cannot be distracted.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few ways you can alert others that you cannot be bothered. I've heard things as clever as having a Phillips hue bulb sync with a calendar to turn on and change color to red when in a meeting. But for me, It's simple and effective enough to put a note on the door when I need to focus or am getting ready to jump on a call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"schedule-regular-sync-up-calls-and-status-updates-with-your-colleagues\"><a href=\"#schedule-regular-sync-up-calls-and-status-updates-with-your-colleagues\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Schedule regular sync-up calls and status updates with your colleagues</h2>\n<p>Twice a week (Monday and Wednesday), my team of four and I would meet up virtually after lunch to talk about what our main goals for the week were. If your group is larger than 4-5 people, it may be a good idea to break it up into separate groups with similar goals then have the manager be in both calls. It helps keep everyone engaged with talking to each other. Also, feel free to create a water-cooler chat in Slack or MSTeams to talk about non-work related things.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"The ability to work from home is a trained skill that takes time to master just like anything else.

We have come to need websites that are as flexible as we are. How many times were you on the go, when someone has told you about a new product or service? You then pull out your phone to see what it's all about. The business/product's website you go to isn't responsive, and you have a horrible time getting around the site, pinching, and zooming to try, and read the text. If you are anything like me, I start to get tired of trying to find the information I'm looking for if it's not easily accessible and just abandon looking up more on the product (even if the product itself is great). This is why it's extremely important to have a website that works on any device that the user may be trying to access it from.</p>\n<p>According to official <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/its-official-google-says-more-searches-now-on-mobile-than-on-desktop-220369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google statements</a> from 2019, more than <strong>50%</strong> of search queries globally now come from mobile devices.</p>\n<p>An article from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/mobile-internet-use-passes-desktop-for-the-first-time-study-finds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">TechCrunch</a> back in <strong>2016</strong>, stated that it was the first year that mobile web users have surpassed desktop users, which no longer made marketing websites on desktop only an optional choice.</p>\n<p>There’s even a good chance you’re reading this article on a mobile device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-have-a-responsive-website\"><a href=\"#why-have-a-responsive-website\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Why have a responsive website?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-website-usage-increasing\"><a href=\"#mobile-website-usage-increasing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>Mobile website usage increasing</strong></h3>\n<p>The more general marketing websites I work on, the more I'm starting to see a trend, with at least a <strong>50% tablet/mobile market</strong> to <strong>50% desktop/laptop</strong> market. At the very least, you should have your website work well on Desktop and Mobile. There are plenty of users that browse on a tablet, but that number is usually a bit lower compared to desktop/mobile users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"better-for-user-experience-ux\"><a href=\"#better-for-user-experience-ux\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Better for User Experience (UX)</h3>\n<p>Keeping a consistent look and feel that's similar on type of device is better for brand recognition and how that user interacts with the website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-cost-effective\"><a href=\"#more-cost-effective\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>More cost-effective</strong></h3>\n<p>Building a fully responsive website does add extra hours to a web development project, but that extra up-front cost is worth it in the long run.</p>\n<p>In my personal experience, the clients that say they don't care about responsive websites will soon regret that decision. Taking a site that isn't responsive at all, and trying to convert it over to a responsive website would be like asking for an apple pie, but then deciding you wanted blueberry instead. The crust is still there, but it would be much easier, just to make a new blueberry pie from scratch than fixing what's already there. Same goes with web development, the developer would be usually better off just re-building the website from scratch if a mobile experience wasn't in the original scope of work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"google-recommends-it-for-seo-search-engine-optimization\"><a href=\"#google-recommends-it-for-seo-search-engine-optimization\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>Google recommends it for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</strong></h3>\n<p>When Google Bots take a look at your website, there are multiple things that the search engine looks for. A new thing that it had started doing over the past few years is taking a look to see if it is optimized for the device the user is trying to view it on.</p>\n<p>Say I have a regular non-responsive site that is all about toothpaste. When I go on a desktop, and type Hockey into Google, my page appears to be ranked first. But if I was to go to do that same search for toothpaste on a phone, my page about toothpaste may appear further down the page. With over half the searches coming from mobile nowadays, I'd be losing out on a good chunk of visibility/revenue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"keep-up-with-the-competition\"><a href=\"#keep-up-with-the-competition\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><strong>Keep up with the competition</strong></h3>\n<p>A mobile user is a lot more likely to stay at a website that is mobile-friendly. If your competitor's sites have a better web experience on a competitor's site, they are much more willing to go with that competitor's product.</p>\n<p>There are a few exceptions to needing a mobile responsive website though. One example would be Internal Enterprise websites where the user is on a desktop/laptop for their day job. In cases like this though, the budget that would normally go towards responsive features would go toward better compatibility with legacy browsers. Another example of something that doesn't need to be responsive is a Kiosk or presentation application where the web-app is meant to only be viewed on one particular device.</p>\n<p>If your website is a general marketing site, opt for a responsive website, or go with an agency that uses responsive websites by default.
