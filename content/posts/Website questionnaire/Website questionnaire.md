While building a website for clients, it's a good idea to get a better understanding of exactly why they need a website as well as knowing what content is going to go onto the website and their overall goals. Here is an example website questionnaire that I hand out to clients to get a better understanding of what it is they are looking for, as well as being able to determine the solutions and pricing I need to offer them.

**Note:** that while building your questionnaire, it's a good idea to keep the questions to a minimum. I've also found that most clients feel much more comfortable circling answers, so any question that can be multiple choice, make it multiple choice.
