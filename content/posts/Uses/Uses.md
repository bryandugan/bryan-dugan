Hello! I'm Bryan Dugan, a UI designer and front-end web developer based out of Rochester Hills, Michigan.

This is where I will keep my most up to date setup for anyone curious or just getting started in UI Design and/or Web Development and would like to see what tools other designers/developers use.

## Design/Development Applications

- I design almost entirely in [Sketch](http://sketch.com/).
- I use [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) to prototype all my web applications and give design feedback.
- [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to keep track of UI development tasks.
- I use [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) for branding related projects.
- I write all my code using [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).
    - I use the Base16 Ocean color scheme.
    - I recently started using and enjoying [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- I use [GitHub](https://github.com) to manage all my source code.


## Hosting

- I use [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/ac1815b98d4c) for creating all of my servers. It's easy to use and just works.
- I recently switched to [RunCloud](https://runcloud.io/r/ZMrWgZNDeyRw) on top of Digital Ocean for setting up the server's LEMP stack and managing applications. It takes most of the pain out of managing a server.


## Productivity Applications

- While working, I always have [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) going on in the background with some sort of ambient electronic, or chill-hop music.
- I take all my notes and write blog articles in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=0e97ed20a2904e06a5a22c190f01516a). I then export the completed posts to markdown for my blog.
- I use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for all my team communication.
- I use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) to manage all my active projects.
- [Google Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) is what I use for my Email/calendar, and also take full advantage of docs/sheets to collaborate with teammates.
- [Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) is a great simple application that automatically reverses the scroll on different devices. While using a mouse I like to have normal scrolling, but while using a trackpad, I prefer reverse scrolling.
- [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) for organizing windows.
- [Spark](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641?mt=12) is what I use as my Email client. It's a fantastic, free and beautiful Email client.
- Managing a lot of user accounts, I use [1password](https://1password.com/) to store all my passwords.
- [Harvest](http://try.hrv.st/1-683890) for Time Tracking and Invoices


## Hardware

- I currently use a 15-inch late-2013 Macbook Pro.
- I use the [Samsung U32J590UQN 32″ 4k Monitor](https://amzn.to/3ghi98Q) as my primary monitor. It's a wonderful large budget 4k monitor for basic design work and web development.
- To the right of the primary monitor I keep my Macbook Display opened and use it as a secondary display. I use the [Rain mStand](https://amzn.to/2XpXfMb) in space gray to prop up the laptop.
- After using the external Apple Trackpad for about the last five years, I recently switched back to using a mouse. I have the [Logitech g502](https://amzn.to/2LXgZ4C) along with the [Steelseries QcK Medium](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-QcK-Cloth-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B000UEZ36W/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1IN3O6QU2K3JH&keywords=steelseries%2Bqck&qid=1571695695&sprefix=steelseries%2B%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-2&th=1) which is one of my favorite simplistic mousepads of all time.
- I use an older [Apple Bluetooth Keyboard](https://amzn.to/36yJtes) from 2013 that takes two AA batteries.
- For file storage and backups I use a [Synology DS213](https://amzn.to/2XlRrTU) with two [6TB Western Digital Red](https://amzn.to/3ghXIIN) hard drives that are mirrored. I have it setup so every night, it backs up whatever new data there is from Google Drive.
- I absolutely love the [Apple Airpods](https://amzn.to/3ghXIIN). I use them throughout the day for listening to music, while on conference calls and going to the gym.


## Other Gear

- The desk that I currently use is the [Autonomous SmartDesk 2, Business Edition](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business?option1=1&option2=5&option16=37&option17=41) with the Walnut Top 53"x29" Classic, Black Platform and cable tray. It's a good desk for it's price point, though the top is starting to scuff just after a year of usage. I might look into making a custom top for it in the future.
- My office chair is an [Autonomous Ergochair](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair). It's a decent chair for it's price point, although I'd love to upgrade to a Herman Miller Aeron in the future.
- The [Canon T5i](https://amzn.to/2Xrgcy8) is the perfect mix of price to performance. The camera is an older model, but perfect for doing any general product photography.
- The backpack I use is the [OGIO Renegade 17″ Backpack](https://amzn.to/3eeEdiv). Every pocket of the backpack is extremely well thought out. I'm a huge fan of OGIO products and I also use their gym bag, and a golf bag from them as well.
- I currently use the iPhone XS. I only update my phone if it's completely necessary. Usually a phone will last me 4-5 years before it's time for it to be replaced.
- I absolutely love [Baron Fig Notebooks](https://www.baronfig.com/). To me, they are the perfect size for jotting down notes and general usage.
- I'm not huge into home automation, but I am obsessed with [Phillips Hue Bulbs](https://amzn.to/2LWbq6w), my home/office is decked out with the bulbs, play bars, light strips and wall switches.
