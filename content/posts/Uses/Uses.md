Hello! I'm Bryan Dugan, a UX/UI designer, and developer based out of Rochester Hills, Michigan.

This page is where I will keep my most up-to-date setup for anyone curious or just getting started in UX/UI Design or Web Development and would like to see what tools other designers/developers use.

## Design/Development Applications

-   [Figma](https://figma.com/) for design and prototypes.
-   [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) for site mapping and information architecture.
-   [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to hand off completed prototype screens to dev teams.
-   [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) for branding-related projects.
-   [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my daily code editor along with the [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) color scheme (without the glow effects) along with the Monaco font on macOS.
-   [GitHub](https://github.com/) to manage all my source code.
-   [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for a better Terminal experience along with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and the [Agnoster theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme).
-   [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet) for my local dev environment along with [PHP Monitor](https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/phpmon) to quickly switch between different versions of PHP and modify config files.
-   [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for my Git client.

## Hosting

-   [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/ac1815b98d4c) for creating all of my servers. It's easy to use and manage.
-   [RunCloud](https://runcloud.io/r/ZMrWgZNDeyRw) on top of Digital Ocean to set up the server's LEMP stack and manage applications. It takes most of the pain out of managing a server. As a bonus, it handles deployments and does webapp backups.

## Productivity Applications

-   [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) is always open in the background with ambient, electronic, or chill-hop music.
-   [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=0e97ed20a2904e06a5a22c190f01516a) for all my notetaking and blog articles. I then export the completed posts to markdown for my blog. I also use Notion to handle any launch checklists or processes I need to do regularly.
-   For large projects, I use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) or [Asana](https://asana.com/) to manage tasks.
-   [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to create to-do lists quickly or set up quick tasks for the week for personal to-dos.
-   [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) to manage all my active projects.
-   [Google Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) is what I use for my Email/calendar, and I also take full advantage of docs/sheets to collaborate with teammates.
-   [Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) is a simple application that automatically reverses the scroll on different devices. While using a mouse, I like to have normal scrolling, but while using a trackpad, I prefer reverse scrolling.
-   [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) for organizing windows.
-   [Spark](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641?mt=12) is what I use as my Email client. It's a fantastic, free and beautiful Email client.
-   Managing a lot of user accounts, I use [1password](https://1password.com/) to store all my passwords.
-   [Harvest](http://try.hrv.st/1-683890) for time tracking and Invoices.
-   [Contrast](https://usecontrast.com/) for quickly checking color accessibility.
-   [CleanShot](https://cleanshot.com/) for taking better screenshots, and short screen captures.

## Hardware

-   I currently use a base-model 16-inch late-2019 Macbook Pro in Space Gray.
-   I use the [Samsung U32J590UQN 32″ 4k Monitor](https://amzn.to/3ghi98Q) as my primary monitor. It's a decent large budget 4k monitor for design work and web development.
-   To the primary monitor's right, I keep my Macbook Display opened and use it as a secondary display. I use the [Rain mStand](https://amzn.to/2XpXfMb) in space gray to prop up the laptop.
-   I use the [Caldigit TS3 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CZPV8DF/) as my docking station to run my mouse, webcam, monitor, and charge my laptop all at the same time.
-   After using the external Apple Trackpad for about the last five years, I recently switched back to using a mouse. I have the [Logitech g502](https://amzn.to/2LXgZ4C) and the [Steelseries QcK Medium](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-QcK-Cloth-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B000UEZ36W/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1IN3O6QU2K3JH&keywords=steelseries%2Bqck&qid=1571695695&sprefix=steelseries%2B%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-2&th=1), one of my favorite simplistic mousepads of all time.
-   I use an older [Apple Bluetooth Keyboard](https://amzn.to/36yJtes) from 2013. I'm not a fan of mechanical keyboards.
-   For file storage and backups, I use a [Synology DS213](https://amzn.to/2XlRrTU) with two [6TB Western Digital Red](https://amzn.to/3ghXIIN) hard drives set up to be mirrored. I have it set up so every night, it backs up whatever new data there is from Google Drive. I also have it set up to do my Time Machine backups.
-   I love the [Apple Airpods](https://amzn.to/3ghXIIN). I use them throughout the day for listening to music while on conference calls and going to the gym.
-   [Logitech C910](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-HD-Pro-Webcam-C910/dp/B00524UKF4/) is my older, yet still good webcam.

## Other Gear

-   The desk that I currently use is the [Autonomous SmartDesk 2, Business Edition](https://bit.ly/3eGgNTu) with the Walnut Top 53"x29" Classic, Black Platform, and cable tray. It's a suitable desk for its price point, though the top is starting to scuff just after a year of usage. I might look into making a custom top for it in the future.
-   My office chair is an [Autonomous Ergochair](https://bit.ly/3eGgNTu). It's a decent chair for its price point, although I'd love to upgrade to a Herman Miller Aeron or Mirra 2 in the future.
-   I use the [OGIO Renegade 17″ Backpack](https://amzn.to/3eeEdiv). Every pocket of the bag is extremely well thought out. I'm a big fan of OGIO products, and I use their gym bag and a golf bag from them as well.
-   I currently use the iPhone XS. I only update my phone if it's necessary. Usually, a phone will last me 4-5 years before it's time for it to be replaced.
-   I love [Baron Fig Notebooks](https://www.baronfig.com/). To me, they are the perfect size for jotting down notes and general usage.
-   I'm not huge into home automation, but I am obsessed with [Phillips Hue Bulbs](https://amzn.to/2LWbq6w). My home and the home office is decked out with bulbs, play bars, light strips, and wall switches.
-   I recently got into printing my artwork and found the [Canon IP8720](https://amzn.to/3luX9gP) to be the perfect entry-level printer.
-   My turntable is the [REGA Planar 1 Plus](https://amzn.to/3jGwgpG) in White. The plus model has a built-in preamp for modern systems that you can turn on/off. If you're looking for a new record player, be sure to go through [Audio Advisor](https://www.audioadvisor.com/) out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. My experience through them has been great.
