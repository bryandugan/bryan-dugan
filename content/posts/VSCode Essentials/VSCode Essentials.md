This article is a collection of everything needed to get started using Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode). This article also uses all Mac OSX shortcuts and is geared towards a front-end developer's setup.

## Why use VSCode?

As a front-end developer, I have tried and used many different code editors, from Notepad++, TextWrangler, Dreamweaver, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, back to Sublime Text, PHPStorm, and finally to VSCode. I have been using VSCode as my primary code editor for the past six months and am enjoying how easy and intuitive it is to use.

VSCode is a free code editor that runs on all major platforms. In that regard, it makes things extremely easy to get started.

> It doesn't matter which code editor you use, as long as you're proficient in it, and **YOU** enjoy using it. What works for everyone else might not work for you.

## Commonly used shortcuts

Learning shortcuts on any new program takes a while, but it's worth it in the long run. They help save time while writing code. Here is a list of some of the basics that I find myself using over and over again.

| Action | Shortcut |
| :--- | :--- |
| Duplicate Line | `opt` + `shift` + `up`/`down` |
| Move Line up/down | `opt` + `up`/`down` |
| Copy Line up/down | `cmd` + `opt` + `up`/`down` |
| Cut Line | `cmd` + `x` |
| Delete Line | `cmd + shift + k` |
| Show/Hide Sidebar | `cmd ` + `b` |
| File Switcher | `cmd` + `p` |

| Open Terminal | `ctrl` + `` ` `` |

| Find / Replace | `cmd` + `option` + `f` |
| Go to last file you were in | `cmd` + `p` + `p`|
| Sidebar Focus | `cmd` + `0` |
| Code Editor Focus | `cmd` + `1` |
| Open File on sidebar | `cmd` + `down` |
| Rename/Refactor | `f2` |
| Extract code from function | `cmd` + `ctrl` + `.` |

## Troubleshooting
A list of common issues I have come across along with the fixes for them.

- Use Prettier through ESLint in Javascript and not Prettier plugin settings.


## Themes

VSCode has countless themes to get you the perfect theme for writing code. I prefer dark themes, so this list comprises all dark themes that I have either used and enjoyed. If you have any light themes that you enjoy using, please contact me on Twitter [@bryandugan](https://twitter.com/bryandugan) and let me know!


[**Material Theme →**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)

The Material Theme has quickly become extremely popular among popular code editors. Instead of only changing the color scheme, unlike all the other themes in this list, it takes over the full interface and changes icons and the entire application's look and feel to match Google's Material design spec. You may also use the Material theme along with any of the color schemes in this list.

[**SynthWave '84 →**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)

A Synthwave inspired color theme that lets you live your digital dreams. I have recently switched over to this theme and am enjoying it.

[**Base16 Ocean Dark Extended Theme →**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kleber-swf.ocean-dark-extended)

One of my favorite themes of all time ported over to VSCode.

[**Cobalt 2 →**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2)

[**Night Owl →**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)

A nice looking dark theme for night owls created by Sarah Drasner.

## Extensions

One of the things that make Visual Studio Code so powerful is its use of extensions. You can customize your editor to have as many extensions as you need. Below is a list of extensions that I have used at one time or another and that you may find useful. Don't feel obligated to install them all; just the ones you believe could enhance your workflow. It's easy to go overboard installing extensions while learning VSCode, but remember less is always more while learning. Don't let finding extensions get in the way of you doing your work.
