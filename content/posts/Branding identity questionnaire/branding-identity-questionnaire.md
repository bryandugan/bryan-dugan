When doing a branding and identity project for a client, it's a good idea to gather an understanding of exactly what they are looking for in their brand and understand their overall goals. This also helps determine the scope of work and pricing. Use this questionnaire as a starting point for creating your own.

While building your questionnaire, it's a good idea to keep the questions to a minimum. I've also found that most clients feel much more comfortable circling answers and feed off any examples that are given.

Also, instead of handing out a worksheet, this questionnaire can be presented during a meeting and filled out together or over a conference call.
